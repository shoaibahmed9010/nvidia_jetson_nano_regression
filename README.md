# nvidia_jetson_nano_regression
This task demonstrates regression by means of NVIDIA Jetson Nano. User can keep a track of their eyes and nose and after rigorous training, it will track the user's eyes and nose in real-time. This was just a practice exercise and its applications can be scaled up to match the needs for implementing regression by means of Deep Learning.
